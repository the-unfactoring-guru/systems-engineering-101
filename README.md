# Systems Engineering 101: Programming Fundamentals

This course is for people who want to learn programming with no experience. In this 101 course we are going to learn the basics on how to be an engineer that works in any type of information technology career. Through out the course we will see topics like:

- Git
- Programming Languages
- Basic Programming (variables, conditionals, statements, loops, etc.)
- Object Oriented Programming (classes, objects, methods, attributes, etc.)
- Data Structures (arrays, lists, graphs, stacks, queues, etc.)
- Introduction to Common Algorithms

## How is this course different from what you see in college?

Most university classes divide these topics into different semesters. While this course can take up 1-3 months. We also depend more on giving fun activities through developing a "videogame". I say this basically because what we learn can be applied to videogame logic. This approach is chosen to create a more fun environment when learning to code.

## Where can i see the course?

I may be will stream it on my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/the_unfactoring_guru). But I will upload a [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com)

### Happy Coding
